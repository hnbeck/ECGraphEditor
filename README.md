# ECGraphEditor
A small tool to connect to a Neo4j database, edit the network and write it back.

**This software is pre-alpha, if you want to use it do it at your own risk ! Your Neo4j database may be changed**
It is intended for non-commercial and non-productive use only.

## Libraries
This tool uses 

- **RNeo4j** from Nicole White [details here] (http://github.com/nicolewhite/RNeo4j)
- **visNetwork** from Benoit Thieurmel [details here] (http://dataknowledge.github.io/visNetwork/)
- **Neo4j** of course [details here] (http://neo4j.com/)

Thanks for this very useful packages !

## Usage
**Attention:** at this moment in time, this tool can be used only with my adaption of visNetwork
It is not clear when this changes will be adapted (if ever) by the mainstream visNetork. If not, 
my changes will be integrated in this repository

In general the workflow

- ECGraphEditor asks the database which labels, properties for nodes and which relationships are available
- you select which labels and relationships to load
- you select which property of the nodes (one per node of selected label) are displayed in graph
  (only one property per node of selected label and time can be handled at the moment)
- load graph, edit
- save graph back to Neo4J
- node / edge IDs will be generated by Neo4j when added nodes are saved to database

More details to come.
